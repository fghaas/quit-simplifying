## Three theories to explain the universe

<!-- Note -->
As far as we know, there are three fundamental physical theories that, combined, explain the universe as we know it: 

* general relativity, which explains mass, energy, spacetime, and gravity;
* quantum mechanics and the Standard Model, which explain the other three fundamental forces of nature --- electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force ---, which in turn explains structure, and they nature of atoms, and ultimately chemistry;
* and finally, thermodynamics, which among other things explains heat, and work.

Thermodynamics has a famous Second Law that can be stated in various ways — in one modern and simplified form, we say:


## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The total entropy of a system never decreases.

<!-- Note -->
Now, what does that mean?


## Entropy

The degree to which things are disorderly.

<!-- Note -->
“Entropy,” in this context, is essentially the degree to which the system is disorderly.
In effect, the Second Law states that any system can stay just as orderly as it is now, or it can become more disorderly, but it can never again become as orderly as it once was.

The normal state of the world is that things keep getting more and more disorderly.

There are multiple classic examples of this: 

* you can mix two paints in a bucket but cannot unmix them, 
* you can open a container of gas in a vacuum chamber and the gas will disperse but never go back into the container, 
* you can scramble and cook an egg but never return it to its original protein structure.


## A curious consequence

growth in entropy

=

passage of time

<!-- Note -->
What does that mean for each of us, individually? 
It means, bluntly speaking, that our lives get objectively and perpetually messier over time.

I don’t know if you’re in a better or worse place than you were 10 or 20 years ago in your life, but I’m pretty sure that you’re in a more *complicated* place now. 


## Backwards time travel

Not an option.

<!-- Note -->
And many of us might probably want to go back to our less-complicated life from back then, but alas, backwards time travel (and hence entropy reduction, read: “a more orderly life”) is not an option.

Now as long as you’re just trying (and failing) to rewind disorder in your own life, then — as long as you live and work alone — that will probably not have a harmful effect on anyone.

But it gets tricky when you’re applying the same thinking to living with a spouse, or in a family.
Good luck trying to rewind your life with teenage offspring, for example, to the presumably simpler time when they were three month old babies that slept most of the day.

But let’s also talk about how this affects work in a management position.


## A manager's job <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

### Takeaway #4
If you are a manager, it's your job to slow the growth of disorder in the part of the organization you manage.

<!-- Note -->
You won’t be able to *reduce* disorder, and any attempt to do so pits you against a most fundamental law of physics.

(Laws of physics are like terrorists: you shouldn’t attempt to negotiate with them.) 


## Most managers == entropy accelerators

<!-- Note -->
However, many managers are exactly the opposite: they are entropy accelerators; they speed up the growth of disorder in the organization.

I've met one manager who looked at the Slack channel that their team used and found that communications were poor and chaotic, and it was impossible to follow what was happening.

Their solution: more channels.
(More channels that *everyone* who previously followed one channel now had to follow.)

This is not a singular example.
This sort of thing happens all the time.

I posit that this is largely due to an oddly misguided fetish we have for the thing we call "leadership".

People seem to believe that in order to be useful, people must **lead**, they must **do**, they must **direct** others, when in reality there are at least three productive things that people can do when they collaborate.
And one of them is not necessarily better than the others.


## Productive things people can do <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

### Lead,

### Follow,

### Or get out of the way.

(George S. Patton, paraphrased)
