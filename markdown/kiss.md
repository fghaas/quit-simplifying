# The KISS principle <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

## K.I.S.S.

<!-- Note -->
I suppose everyone is familiar with the K.I.S.S. principle.

Curiously, there doesn't appear to be much consensus as to what that acronym actually expands to.
There are several options:


<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->
# Keep it simple, stupid! <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
Keep it simple, stupid!

<!-- Note -->
"Keep it simple, you idiot."


<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->
# Keep it simple and stupid <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
Keep it simple and stupid

<!-- Note -->
"Don't just try to not be complicated, also try to not be clever."


<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->
# Keep it small and simple <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
Keep it small and simple

<!-- Note -->
This one sidesteps the "stupid" bit.


<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->
# simple && (stupid || small) <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
`simple && (stupid || small)` 

<!-- Note -->
But we appear to agree that we want to keep things simple, and then also keep them either stupid, or small.

But however we expand the acronym, this bit is important:


## K.I.S.S. ≠ M.I.S.S. 

<!-- Note -->
It's about **keeping** things simple, not about **making** anything simple.

The principle as such is quite aptly named: it reminds us that the important bit is to **keep** things simple while we can, *precisely because* it's impossible to **make** them simple (or simpler) later on.


### Takeaway #5

Aim to **keep** things simple, because you can't **make** them simple.
