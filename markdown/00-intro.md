<!-- Note -->
In this talk, I explain the concepts of complexity and entropy, and I discuss why the Second Law of Thermodynamics derails the idea of simplification. I delve into why it is that managers, even if they have the purest of intentions and a great desire to simplify, usually end up doing the opposite. And finally I explain what leaders (formal and informal ones) can and should do to mitigate the very real (and usually negative) consequences of the simplification myth.

Please snap this QR code now, and you'll get the slides on your phone or tablet, advancing in lockstep with mine.

In particular, if you are prone to migraines and can't stare at a bright screen for a long time, please do make use of this, because on your device you will see the slides with a reversed colour scheme.
