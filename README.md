# Quit Simplifying!
DevOps is frequently understood as a framework to simplify complex things. This is bound to fail.

In this talk, I explain the concepts of complexity and entropy, and I discuss why the Second Law of Thermodynamics derails the idea of simplification. I delve into why it is that managers, even if they have the purest of intentions and a great desire to simplify, usually end up doing the opposite. And finally I explain what leaders (formal and informal ones) can and should do to mitigate the very real (and usually negative) consequences of the simplification myth.
